<h1>Spring 2024 PHI Applicants</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
I had the opportunity to undertake a project involving the creation of a dashboard using Power BI for Filipino students. The primary objective of this project was to develop a comprehensive and visually appealing data visualization platform that catered specifically to the needs and interests of students in the Philippines. The dashboard aimed to consolidate various pertinent educational data, such as attendance, grades, and performance trends, students who matriculated, their mentors, and work-study schedule as well as those who needed jobs into an easily understandable format that would assist students in tracking their progress and making informed decisions about their academic journey. Through extensive research on the education system in the Philippines and interviews with students themselves, I was able to gather valuable insights into their preferences and requirements for such a tool. Armed with this knowledge, I designed a user-friendly interface with interactive features that allowed students to customize their dashboards based on their objectives and priorities. This project served as an essential tool in empowering Filipino students by enabling them to take ownership of their education while providing educators with valuable insights into student performance on a macro level as well as allowing them to be employed remotely by some of the best American companies.
